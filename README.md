# Diabetes-prediction
End-to-end diabetes prediction project using machine learning, covering data preprocessing, model evaluation and selection, and deployment via a Streamlit web app. 
Diabetes Prediction project that evaluates patient health inputs to determine the likelihood of diabetes using machine learning.
The system applies structured data preprocessing, feature selection, and trained models to deliver consistent, explainable predictions focused on real-world clinical decision support rather than superficial accuracy claims.
